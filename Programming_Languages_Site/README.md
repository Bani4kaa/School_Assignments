<h1>HTML site - Programming languages</h1>
<p>In this assignment I had to create a site using HTML,CSS and not much JS. The site has a log-in page after which you'll fing a main page and a menu with 6 other pages.
All of them are about coding and aim to give as little and easy as possible information, mainly for begginers.</p>
